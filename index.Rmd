# Prerequisites

This is a book written in **Markdown** which contains all the materials and lessons for data analytics one. If you miss a day, want to review something we covered in class, or for any reason want to look for a worksheet, this is where you can go. 

Each chapter contains a different topic we will cover during the semester. Some larger topics are split into two chapters to make accessing the materials a little more intuitive. 

This book is updated automatically with any changes made to the documents during the semester, so if at any point you are told there was a change in the assignment, you can come here to get the updated version.

```{r include=FALSE}
# automatically create a bib database for R packages
knitr::write_bib(c(
  .packages(), 'bookdown', 'knitr', 'rmarkdown'
), 'packages.bib')
```
