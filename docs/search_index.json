If you miss a day, want to review something we covered in class, or for any reason want to look for a worksheet, this is where you can go. Each chapter contains a different topic we will cover during the semester. Some larger topics are split into two chapters to make accessing the materials a little more intuitive. This book is updated automatically with any changes made to the documents during the semester, so if at any point you are told there was a change in the assignment, you can come here to get the updated version. 1.1 About R R is a software language for carrying out complicated (and simple) statistical analyses. It includes routines for data summary and exploration, graphical presentation and data modelling. The aim of this document is to provide you with a basic fluency in the language. It is suggested that you work through this document at the computer, having started an R session. Type in all of the commands that are printed, and check that you understand how they operate. Then try the simple exercises at the end of each section. When you work in R you create objects that are stored in the current workspace (sometimes called image). Each object created remains in the image unless you explicitly delete it. At the end of the session the workspace will be lost unless you save it. You can save the workspace at any time by clicking on the disc icon at the top of the control panel. Commands written in R are saved in memory throughout the session. You can scroll back to previous commands typed by using the up arrow key (and down to scroll back again). You can also copy and paste using standard windows editor techniques (for example, using the copy and paste dialog buttons). If at any point you want to save the transcript of your session, click on File and then Save History, which will enable you to save a copy of the commands you have used for later use. As an alternative you might copy and paste commands manually into a notepad editor or something similar. "]]
